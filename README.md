**It is a work in progress. Some features are unimplemented yet.**

The helmsman's goal is to be a way to browse articles without all the distractions that modern websites have. Another goal is to improve the accessibility of articles by making them easier for screen readers to consume.

## Operating Modes

### Web Directory

On the first page, content curated by the site maintainer with links to articles relevant to the topic you want to address.

### Web Proxy

A proxy that automatically converts articles to a readable format.

### Command Line Tool

Capturing articles, removing all extra content, leaving only the text and relevant parts, ready to be consumed by other programs like screen readers, ready to be cataloged, etc.

## Road Map

- Basic server and test the concept
- Front page
- Ability to be a directory, with a catalog of links to visit
- Ability to be customize by the user, changing themes, etc.
- Act as HTTP proxy
